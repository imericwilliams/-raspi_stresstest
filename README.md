# -raspi_stresstest

The goal of this script is to stress test a raspberry pi and note if it can remain stable under these conditions by measuring its temperature and frequency.


Note: This is a preliminary script ("tester.sh"), but the script can be modified and other scripts have been provided (in which these other scripts cna be used as references).
